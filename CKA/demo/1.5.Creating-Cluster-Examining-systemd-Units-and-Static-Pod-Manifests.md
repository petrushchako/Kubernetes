# Demo:<br>Creating a Cluster - Examining systemd Units and Static Pod Manifests

Now that the control plane node is up, running, and bootstrapped, let's explore the systemd units, static pod manifests, and kubeconfig files used by Kubernetes components.

<br>

### Step 1: Check the Kubelet Systemd Unit
Run the following command to check the status of the `kubelet` service:

```bash
sudo systemctl status kubelet.service
```

You should now see the status as `active (running)`, instead of `inactive (dead)`. This is because the `kubeadm init` process has created static pod manifests that the kubelet uses to start the core control plane pods.

<br>

### Step 2: Explore the Static Pod Manifest Directory
The static pod manifests are written to:

```
/etc/kubernetes/manifests
```

Each file in this directory represents one of the control plane components as a static pod:
- `etcd.yaml`
- `kube-apiserver.yaml`
- `kube-controller-manager.yaml`
- `kube-scheduler.yaml`

<br>

### Step 3: View Static Pod Manifest Contents
Use `more` or `cat` to inspect the content of one of the manifests, such as the API server:

```bash
sudo more /etc/kubernetes/manifests/kube-apiserver.yaml
```

Inside the file, you will see:
- Pod configuration
- Command-line arguments
- Volumes and mounts
- Resource definitions
- Certificates and authentication info

You can also view other manifests similarly:

```bash
sudo more /etc/kubernetes/manifests/etcd.yaml
```

> **Exam Tip**: Know where the static pod manifests live. This directory is important for troubleshooting scenarios.

<br>

### Step 4: Locate kubeconfig Files
The kubeconfig files used by control plane components are located in:

```
/etc/kubernetes/
```

Key kubeconfig files include:
- `admin.conf` – Used by `kubectl` and administrative users
- `controller-manager.conf` – Used by the controller manager
- `scheduler.conf` – Used by the scheduler
- `kubelet.conf` – Used by the kubelet to talk to the API server

These files contain cluster access information, certificates, and user authentication configuration.

<br>

### Step 5: Other Important Directories
- **Manifests Directory**:  
  `/etc/kubernetes/manifests` – Where all static pod definitions are stored.
  
- **PKI Directory**:  
  `/etc/kubernetes/pki` – Contains certificates and keys for TLS authentication in the cluster.

This exploration lays the foundation for future troubleshooting scenarios. Understanding where static pod manifests and kubeconfig files reside is essential for diagnosing and resolving issues in a Kubernetes control plane.

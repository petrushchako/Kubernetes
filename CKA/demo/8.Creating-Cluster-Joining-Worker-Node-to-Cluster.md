# Demo:<br>Joining a Worker Node to a Cluster
### Step 1: SSH Back to the Control Plane Node
Exit from the worker node (`c1-node1`) and return to the control plane node (`c1-cp1`):
```bash
exit
```

You should now see the shell prompt reflect that you're on `c1-cp1`.

### Step 2: Generate the Join Token Command
Run the following command on the control plane node to generate the `kubeadm join` command:
```bash
kubeadm token create --print-join-command
```

> This will output a full join command with:
> - API server address
> - Join token
> - CA cert hash for secure discovery

> **Tokens expire after 24 hours**. Always regenerate a fresh one if needed.

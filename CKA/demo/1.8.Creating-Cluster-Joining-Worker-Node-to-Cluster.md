# Demo:<br>Joining a Worker Node to a Cluster
### Step 1: SSH Back to the Control Plane Node
Exit from the worker node (`c1-node1`) and return to the control plane node (`c1-cp1`):
```bash
exit
```

You should now see the shell prompt reflect that you're on `c1-cp1`.

<br><br><br>

### Step 2: Generate the Join Token Command
Run the following command on the control plane node to generate the `kubeadm join` command:
```bash
kubeadm token create --print-join-command
```

> This will output a full join command with:
> - API server address
> - Join token
> - CA cert hash for secure discovery

> **Tokens expire after 24 hours**. Always regenerate a fresh one if needed.

<br><br><br>

### Step 3: SSH Back Into the Worker Node
SSH into `c1-node1` again:
```bash
ssh user@c1-node1
```

Replace `user` with the appropriate username.

<br><br><br>

### Step 4: Join the Cluster
Paste the `kubeadm join` command you copied earlier into the shell. It will look something like this:
```bash
sudo kubeadm join 192.168.0.100:6443 \
  --token abcdef.0123456789abcdef \
  --discovery-token-ca-cert-hash sha256:1234567890abcdef...
```

> Add `sudo` to ensure appropriate permissions.  
> This process will:
> - Run preflight checks  
> - Perform TLS Bootstrap  
> - Register the node with the API server

At the end, you should see output like:

```
This node has joined the cluster:
* Certificate signing request was sent to the API server
* The kubelet was informed of the new configuration
```

<br><br><br>

### Step 5: Confirm Node Status from Control Plane
SSH back to the control plane node:

```bash
exit
```

Run the following to verify:
```bash
kubectl get nodes
```

Expected output:
```
NAME         STATUS   ROLES    AGE     VERSION
c1-cp1       Ready    control-plane   Xm     v1.32.0
c1-node1     Ready    <none>          1m     v1.32.0
```

> The worker node should show `Ready` status after a brief delay.

You can also watch pod deployments on the node:
```bash
kubectl get pods --all-namespaces --watch
```

Look for:

- `calico-node`
- `kube-proxy`

These should deploy shortly after the node joins.

<br><br><br>

### Step 6: Join Additional Worker Nodes
Repeat the same process on:
- `c1-node2`
- `c1-node3`

This will complete your lab setup with:
- One control plane node (`c1-cp1`)
- Three worker nodes (`c1-node1`, `c1-node2`, `c1-node3`)

# Demo:<br>Creating a Cluster - Deploying a Pod Network
This guide walks you through deploying the Calico pod network on your Kubernetes control plane node and verifying that all system components are running successfully.

<br>

### Step 1: Deploy the Pod Network (Calico)
Apply the Calico deployment manifest using `kubectl`:

```bash
kubectl apply -f calico.yaml
```

> This manifest sets up the pod network for the cluster. It may take a few minutes for the components to come online.

<br>

### Step 2: Check System Pod Status
Monitor the progress of the control plane and network component pods:

```bash
kubectl get pods --all-namespaces
```

> This command shows all running system pods across all namespaces, including those deployed by `kubeadm`.

<br>

### Expected Pods You Will See
These are the core system components you should see initializing or running:
- `kube-scheduler`
- `kube-controller-manager`
- `kube-apiserver`
- `etcd`
- `kube-proxy`
- `coredns` (2 pods)
- Calico components:
  - `calico-node`
  - `calico-kube-controllers`

The CoreDNS pods may initially appear as `ContainerCreating`. Wait a few moments and re-check.

<br>

### Step 3: Watch Pod Status Live (Optional)
If the pods are not yet in a `Running` state, use the `--watch` flag to continuously monitor:

```bash
kubectl get pods --all-namespaces --watch
```

> Press `Ctrl+C` to stop watching once all pods show a `Running` status.

<br>

### Step 4: Confirm All Pods Are Running
Double-check that all pods are in the `Running` state:

```bash
kubectl get pods --all-namespaces
```

> Ensure that all system and Calico pods have successfully transitioned to `Running`.

<br>

### Step 5: Verify Node Status
Confirm that your control plane node is up and ready:

```bash
kubectl get nodes
```

You should see output similar to the following:

```
NAME      STATUS   ROLES           AGE     VERSION
c1-cp1    Ready    control-plane   6m12s   v1.32.0
```

This confirms:
- The node `c1-cp1` is in a `Ready` state
- It is correctly assigned the `control-plane` role
- Kubernetes version is correctly reported

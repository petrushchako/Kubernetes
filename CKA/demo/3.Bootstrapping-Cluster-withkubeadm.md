# Bootstrapping a Cluster with `kubeadm`

Once the necessary Kubernetes packages and container runtime (e.g., containerd) are installed, the next step is to bootstrap the cluster using `kubeadm`.

#### What is `kubeadm`?

`kubeadm` is a CLI tool that simplifies the Kubernetes cluster creation process by guiding you through a set of well-defined phases.

### `kubeadm init` â€“ Cluster Initialization Phases

Running the command:

```bash
sudo kubeadm init
```

will trigger the following steps:

#### 1. Pre-Flight Checks
- Verifies system readiness:
  - Sufficient CPU and memory
  - Proper permissions (e.g., root/sudo)
  - Working container runtime (e.g., containerd)
- Any failure stops the process with helpful error messages.

#### 2. Certificate Authority Generation
- A Certificate Authority (CA) is created to enable authentication and secure communication between cluster components.

#### 3. Kubeconfig Files Generation
- These files are used by cluster components (e.g., `kubelet`, `controller-manager`) to authenticate against the API server.
- You also get a kubeconfig for the admin user, stored in:
  ```
  /etc/kubernetes/admin.conf
  ```

#### 4. Static Pod Manifests
- `kubeadm` writes static pod YAML files for control plane components such as:
  - `kube-apiserver`
  - `kube-controller-manager`
  - `etcd`
- These manifests are stored in:
  ```
  /etc/kubernetes/manifests/
  ```
- The `kubelet` watches this directory and automatically starts these pods.

#### 5. Control Plane Startup
- Waits for the control plane pods (API server, etcd, etc.) to become healthy and running.

#### 6. Tainting the Control Plane Node
- The control plane node is tainted to prevent regular workloads from being scheduled on it:
  ```bash
  kubectl taint nodes <node-name> node-role.kubernetes.io/control-plane:NoSchedule
  ```

#### 7. Bootstrap Token Creation
- A bootstrap token is created to allow other nodes to securely join the cluster using `kubeadm join`.

#### 8. Add-On Pods Deployment
- Core add-ons such as:
  - CoreDNS
  - kube-proxy
- These ensure networking and service discovery are functional.

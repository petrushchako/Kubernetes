# Demo:<br> Using kubectl Nodes, Pods, API Resources and bash Auto-Completion
This demo focused on utilizing the `kubectl` command-line tool to interact with a Kubernetes cluster. We explored commands for inspecting nodes, pods, and other API resources. Additionally, we covered how to configure Bash auto-completion for `kubectl`.

## Inspecting the Kubernetes Cluster
The `kubectl cluster-info` command provides information about the cluster the current `kubectl` context is pointing to.
```bash
kubectl cluster-info
```

The output displays the address of the Kubernetes control plane.

## Working with Nodes
The `kubectl get nodes` command lists the nodes in the Kubernetes cluster and their basic status.
```bash
kubectl get nodes
```

The output includes the node's name, status (e.g., `Ready`), role (e.g., `control-plane`, `master`, `<none>`), age, and Kubernetes version.

The `-o wide` output modifier adds more details to the `kubectl get nodes` output.
```bash
kubectl get nodes -o wide
```

This extended output includes the internal IP address, external IP address (if applicable), OS image, kernel version, and container runtime information for each node.

## Working with Pods
The `kubectl get pods` command lists the pods running in the default namespace. If no workload has been deployed in the default namespace, it will return "No resources found."
```bash
kubectl get pods
```

To view pods in a specific namespace, such as the `kube-system` namespace (where system pods reside), use the `--namespace` flag.
```bash
kubectl get pods --namespace kube-system
```

The output shows the pod's name, readiness status (number of containers ready out of total), status (e.g., `Running`, `ContainerCreating`), restarts, and age.

The `-o wide` output modifier can also be used with `kubectl get pods` to display additional information like the pod's IP address, the node it's running on, nominated node, and readiness gates.
```bash
kubectl get pods --namespace kube-system -o wide
```

We observed that pods can have IP addresses from different networks depending on their role (e.g., pod network `192.168.0.0/16` for internal services, infrastructure network `172.16.94.0/24` for external-facing services like the API server and `kube-proxy`). A `kube-proxy` pod runs on each node to implement service networking.

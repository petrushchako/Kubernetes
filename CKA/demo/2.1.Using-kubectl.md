# Demo:<br> Using kubectl Nodes, Pods, API Resources and bash Auto-Completion
This demo focused on utilizing the `kubectl` command-line tool to interact with a Kubernetes cluster. We explored commands for inspecting nodes, pods, and other API resources. Additionally, we covered how to configure Bash auto-completion for `kubectl`.

## Inspecting the Kubernetes Cluster
The `kubectl cluster-info` command provides information about the cluster the current `kubectl` context is pointing to.
```bash
kubectl cluster-info
```

The output displays the address of the Kubernetes control plane.

<br><br>

## Working with Nodes
The `kubectl get nodes` command lists the nodes in the Kubernetes cluster and their basic status.
```bash
kubectl get nodes
```

The output includes the node's name, status (e.g., `Ready`), role (e.g., `control-plane`, `master`, `<none>`), age, and Kubernetes version.

The `-o wide` output modifier adds more details to the `kubectl get nodes` output.
```bash
kubectl get nodes -o wide
```

This extended output includes the internal IP address, external IP address (if applicable), OS image, kernel version, and container runtime information for each node.

## Working with Pods
The `kubectl get pods` command lists the pods running in the default namespace. If no workload has been deployed in the default namespace, it will return "No resources found."
```bash
kubectl get pods
```

To view pods in a specific namespace, such as the `kube-system` namespace (where system pods reside), use the `--namespace` flag.
```bash
kubectl get pods --namespace kube-system
```

The output shows the pod's name, readiness status (number of containers ready out of total), status (e.g., `Running`, `ContainerCreating`), restarts, and age.

The `-o wide` output modifier can also be used with `kubectl get pods` to display additional information like the pod's IP address, the node it's running on, nominated node, and readiness gates.
```bash
kubectl get pods --namespace kube-system -o wide
```

We observed that pods can have IP addresses from different networks depending on their role (e.g., pod network `192.168.0.0/16` for internal services, infrastructure network `172.16.94.0/24` for external-facing services like the API server and `kube-proxy`). A `kube-proxy` pod runs on each node to implement service networking.

## Listing All Resources
The `kubectl get all` command lists all API resources in the default namespace. Combining it with the `--all-namespaces` flag lists all resources across all namespaces.
```bash
kubectl get all --all-namespaces
```

This provides a comprehensive view of all running resources in the cluster, including pods, services, daemon sets, deployments, and replica sets.

## Discovering API Resources
The `kubectl api-resources` command lists all the API resources known to the Kubernetes API server.
```bash
kubectl api-resources | more
```

The output includes the API resource name, short names (aliases), API version, whether it's namespaced, and its kind. Short names can be used as shortcuts in `kubectl` commands (e.g., `kubectl get no` is equivalent to `kubectl get nodes`).

You can filter the output using `grep` to find specific API resources.
```bash
kubectl api-resources | grep pods
```

## Getting Help and Documentation
The `kubectl explain` command provides documentation for a specific API resource.
```bash
kubectl explain pod | more
```

This command displays the kind, API version, a description of the resource, and the fields required to define it. You can drill down into specific fields using dot notation (e.g., `kubectl explain pod.spec`, `kubectl explain pod.spec.containers`).

The `kubectl explain <resource> --recursive` command lists all fields of an API object without the descriptions, which can be useful for quickly recalling field names.
```bash
kubectl explain pod --recursive | less
```

The `kubectl -h` command displays the general help for `kubectl`, listing basic and advanced commands.
```bash
kubectl -h
```

The `kubectl <command> -h` command provides specific help and examples for a particular `kubectl` command.
```bash
kubectl get -h
```

The examples provided in the command-specific help are valuable for understanding command syntax and options.

<br><br>

## Getting Detailed Information about Resources
The `kubectl describe` command provides detailed information about a specific API object, which is extremely useful for troubleshooting.
```bash
kubectl describe node c1-cp1 | more
```

The output includes the resource name, labels, annotations, creation timestamp, taints (for nodes), conditions, addresses, capacity, allocatable resources, system information, and the pods running on the node. This command can be used for any type of Kubernetes resource (e.g., `kubectl describe pod <pod-name>`, `kubectl describe service <service-name>`).

## Enabling Bash Auto-Completion for kubectl
Bash auto-completion can significantly improve the `kubectl` command-line experience by suggesting commands, resource types, resource names, and flags.

The following steps were shown to configure Bash auto-completion:

1.  Install `bash-completion` if it's not already installed.
    ```bash
    sudo apt-get install -y bash-completion
    ```

2.  Add the `kubectl` auto-completion configuration to your `.bashrc` file.
    ```bash
    echo 'source <(kubectl completion bash)' >> ~/.bashrc
    ```

3.  Reload your `.bashrc` file.
    ```bash
    source ~/.bashrc
    ```

After configuration, you can use the Tab key for auto-completion:

* Typing `kube` and pressing Tab twice will show available `kubectl` commands.
* Typing `kubectl g` and pressing Tab twice will auto-complete to `get`.
* Typing `kubectl get po` and pressing Tab twice will auto-complete to `pods`. Pressing Tab again will list available pod names.
* Typing `kubectl get pods --` and pressing Tab twice will show available flags.
* Typing `kubectl get pods --all` and pressing Tab twice will auto-complete to `--all-namespaces`.

Bash auto-completion helps in discovering and correctly typing `kubectl` commands and resource names, making interaction with the Kubernetes cluster more efficient.

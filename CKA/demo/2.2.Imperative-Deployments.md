# Demo:<br>Imperative Deployments and Working with Resources in Your Cluster

In this demo, we explored deploying and managing Kubernetes resources using both imperative and declarative techniques. We focused on deployments, pods, and services, and also looked at how to modify existing resources.

### Imperative Deployment
We began by deploying resources imperatively using the `kubectl create` and `kubectl run` commands.

#### Creating a Deployment Imperatively
```bash
kubectl create deployment hello-world --image=gcr.io/google-samples/hello-app:1.0
```

This command directly instructs Kubernetes to create a deployment named `hello-world` that will run containers based on the `gcr.io/google-samples/hello-app:1.0` image. This action subsequently creates a ReplicaSet and a pod with a single replica.

#### Creating a Bare Pod Imperatively
```bash
kubectl run hello-world-pod --image=gcr.io/google-samples/hello-app:1.0
```

This command directly instructs Kubernetes to run a pod named `hello-world-pod` using the specified image. This pod is not managed by any controller like a Deployment or ReplicaSet.

#### Verifying Deployed Resources
We used `kubectl get pods` to check the status of our deployment and the bare pod. The output showed both pods in a `Running` state.

```
NAME                                READY   STATUS    RESTARTS   AGE
hello-world-5457b44555-gnxsk         1/1     Running   0          14m
hello-world-pod                       1/1     Running   0          13m
```

We also used `kubectl get pods -o wide` to see more details, including the IP addresses assigned to the pods and the nodes they were scheduled on.

```
NAME                                READY   STATUS    RESTARTS   AGE   IP                NODE        NOMINATED NODE   READINESS GATES <none>
hello-world-5457b44555-gnxsk         1/1     Running   0          15m   192.168.206.127   c1-node3    <none>           <none>
hello-world-pod                       1/1     Running   0          14m   192.168.131.62    c1-node2    <none>           <none>
```

#### Examining Containers on a Node
We demonstrated how to SSH into a worker node (`c1-node3` in this case) and use `crictl` (for Containerd runtime) or `docker ps` (for Docker runtime) to view the containers running on that node, including the ones started by Kubernetes.

```bash
sudo crictl --runtime-endpoint unix:///var/run/containerd/containerd.sock ps
```

or

```bash
sudo docker ps
```

The output showed our `hello-app` container running alongside other Kubernetes system containers like `calico-node` and `kube-proxy`.

#### Troubleshooting with `kubectl logs`
The `kubectl logs` command is useful for retrieving logs from a container within a pod.

```bash
kubectl logs hello-world-pod
```

This command displayed the standard output of the `hello-app` container running in the `hello-world-pod`.

#### Interacting with a Running Container using `kubectl exec`

The `kubectl exec` command allows you to run commands inside a container. The `-it` flags provide an interactive terminal.

```bash
kubectl exec -it hello-world-pod -- /bin/sh
```

This command opened a shell session within the `hello-world-pod` container, allowing us to run commands like `hostname` and `ip addr` to inspect the container's environment.

## Understanding Deployments, ReplicaSets, and Pods
We explored the relationship between Deployments, ReplicaSets, and Pods.

#### Examining the Deployment
```bash
kubectl get deployment hello-world
```

This command showed the basic information about the `hello-world` deployment, including the number of desired and ready replicas.

```
NAME          READY   UP-TO-DATE   AVAILABLE   AGE
hello-world   1/1     1            1           24m
```

#### Examining the ReplicaSet
```bash
kubectl get replicaset
```

This command listed the ReplicaSets in the cluster. We observed the ReplicaSet created by our `hello-world` deployment, which manages the actual pods. The ReplicaSet name includes the deployment name and a pod template hash.

```
NAME                      DESIRED   CURRENT   READY   AGE
hello-world-5457b44555    1         1         1       24m
```

#### Examining the Pod
```bash
kubectl get pods
```

This command again listed the pods, and we could see how the pod name (`hello-world-5457b44555-gnxsk`) is derived from the deployment name, the pod template hash from the ReplicaSet, and a unique identifier.

### Using `kubectl describe` for Detailed Information
The `kubectl describe` command provides detailed information about Kubernetes resources.

#### Describing the Deployment
```bash
kubectl describe deployment hello-world | more
```

The output included details like the pod template, the strategy used for updates, and events related to the deployment, such as the scaling of the ReplicaSet.

#### Describing the ReplicaSet
```bash
kubectl describe replicaset hello-world-5457b44555 | more
```

The output showed information about the desired and current state of the ReplicaSet, the pod template it uses, and events like the creation of the pod.

#### Describing the Pod
We used Bash auto-completion to quickly get the full name of the pod associated with the deployment and then described it.

```bash
kubectl describe pod hello-world-5457b44555-gnxsk | more
```

The output for the pod included details about the node it's running on, its IP address, the controller (ReplicaSet) that manages it, container details, and important events in the pod's lifecycle (scheduling, pulling image, creating container, starting container).

The `kubectl describe` command is a crucial tool for troubleshooting issues with deployments and pods, as the events section often provides valuable insights into failures.

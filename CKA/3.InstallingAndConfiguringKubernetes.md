## Installation Considerations
When setting up a Kubernetes cluster, several factors must be considered, including deployment location, networking, scalability, and high availability.  

### **Deployment Options**  
1. **Cloud Deployments**  
   - **Infrastructure as a Service (IaaS):**  
     - Deploy Kubernetes on virtual machines (VMs) in the cloud.  
     - The cloud provider manages networking and infrastructure, but you manage OS, patches, and Kubernetes itself.  
   - **Platform as a Service (PaaS):**  
     - Fully managed Kubernetes services (e.g., AWS EKS, Azure AKS, Google GKE).  
     - No need to manage infrastructure, but limited control over Kubernetes versions and features.  
2. **On-Premises Deployments**  
   - **Bare Metal:**  
     - Kubernetes is installed on physical machines, requiring full infrastructure management.  
   - **Virtual Machines (VMs):**  
     - Kubernetes runs on VMs within an on-premises data center, offering a common alternative to bare metal.

# Helm Installation

### Lab Overview
In this hands-on lab, we will install Helm and configure the standard repository. Once that is complete, we will release a chart to ensure everything is working properly. After the release is verified, we will use Helm to clean up our cluster and remove the resources we created.

### Objectives
- Install and Configure Helm
- Create a Helm Release

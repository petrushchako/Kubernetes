# Modifying Helm Charts

### Lab Overview
Helm provides solutions for customizing charts on the fly. In this hands-on lab, we will modify a chart to allow us to access our application on a node port in our cluster. Being able to access the chart values and knowing how to reference those values at install time can be invaluable in making sure the application works as expected in our environment.

### Learning Objectives
- Create a Release of the Ghost Blog Chart from the cloud_users Home Directory
- Verify the Blog Is Available at the Node Port on the Cluster
